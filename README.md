# Survival_Analysis_ADNI
# Since ADNI dataset is not private, we couldnt include the data needed to preprocess and train. However, we have included all the saved trained models along with .mat files which consist of test data tensors. 


#To Evaluate the models, run the survival_analysis.ipynb file

#To look at the preprocessing, refer to preprocess.ipynb file
