# Survival_Analysis_ADNI
### Since ADNI dataset is not private, we couldnt include the data needed to preprocess and train. However, we have included all the saved trained models along with .mat files which consist of test data tensors. 

## Files
Download and unzip the data file for all tensors needed for evaluation: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--ilnslNGnbJe37yEreQokwark2TNOJh?usp=sharing

Download and Unzip the model file for the saved models: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RqB6g0zTsAyAHpRJJSm-Gu0csJDXYQLa?usp=sharing

## Execution
To Evaluate the models, run the survival_analysis.ipynb file

To look at the preprocessing, refer to preprocess.ipynb file
